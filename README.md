# clean_n_tidy_data
=================

This is the course project for the "Getting and Clean data" on Coursera.

=================

Dataset used in this analysis came from the following link:
[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip][1]

A full description of the data can be found at:
[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones][2]

=================

"run_analsis.R" is the script to perform the analysis.

Purpose of this script is to do the following:

1. Download the data from the above weblink 
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
6. From the data set in step 5, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

==================

This script was designed to run on any R platform. No extra packages are required.

==================

"tidyDS.txt" is the output file and will be saved to the user's Desktop.
